This report is built and maintained by Aaron Beecham.

The Hotkey is used by all support staff members and logs information based on usage by each member.
It is primarily used for template forming for site notes, but as a result also tracks what tasks are being completed by each member.

The Hotkey also has various alternative functions that the support staff utilise to help with general day to day work.
