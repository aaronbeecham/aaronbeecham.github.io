### Loyalty Installs 
All recorded new installations for Loyalty.

*I have no recorded Loyalty Installations for the month of July. This, again, seems highly unlikely, so I believe the reason there are no recorded installs is because whoever did do the installs has failed to record them correctly.*

*This is the second month in a row without a single recorded Loyalty Installation*

# Script Changes for July

First major changes to the script were clearly the introduction of **Matt** and **Jay** to the points screen. Welcome **Matt** and **Jay**! üòÅ

And let's just say, that point screen was well used...

As for other changes, there have been a few minor ones to help with usability. A small change was made for when you do not have access to G drive. An error message will now appear when you attempt to open the Hotkey if you have no connection to G.

A settings menu has been added as a replacement to the about screen. The about screen is gone now and the PGUP function completely removed. The settings screen has minor options to set as you desire. This is where you ensure your name is entered correctly. Also patch notes are listed here.

You can make the Hotkey always show on top of other windows here if you prefer. You can also have the Hotkey open on the Loyalty or Support tab by default with the options here as well. There is also a Manual Update option here that can be run any time you need.

And finally, a change to the Macros screen. It was updated to fit the UI of the current Hotkey design. A description was also added to the top to help explain what this is used for. 

The Macros here are basically autocorrect functions. Enjoy. üéâ

That is all for July 2018.
