# Script Changes for April

Only two significant changes have been made to the script this month. (Outside of general bug fixing and performance improvements)

Staff Points is a new addition that allows everyone to see how they are comparing against everyone else for the current week. It uses the same point system we’ve had in place for all point counting.

Alongside that, I’ve also added a section that allows you to check the raw logs for everyone. This supplies everything from date and time, to the site code and task achieved.
