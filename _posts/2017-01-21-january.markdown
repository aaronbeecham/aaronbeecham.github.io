# GENERAL PREFACE

Early on in the development of the script I have kept a log of every use. Initially it was for discovering bugs/issues with the script but a side effect was that I had a record of all uses of the script. Realising this information may be useful I’ve decided to write this report covering January’s data.

Keep in mind that this information doesn't fully reflect productivity, as there are variables that aren't accounted for (like days off) and relies on the technician accurately recording their actions.

The way that the script is recording information is on a very basic level. At the end of each interaction with the script, it will record the date, time, name and action that was taken to a log file on the G drive. Unfortunately I only have information from November onwards.

# INSTALLS AND DATA OUTAGES
* For January there was a mislabel in the recording that caused all Installations and all Data Outage fixes to be named “General Install”. Keep that in mind while looking at this chart.

* The “General Full Tags” is an option in the script that allows you to create a basic template if you don’t want to use the Install or Data Out template options. It is supposed to be used when you’re not sure if it would go in to the Install or Data Out categories. I believe this section is being used far more than it should be.

# KNOCK BACKS AND FAILED CALLS
Knock Backs and Failed Calls are all the recorded notes taken for any call that resulted in no connection. A Knock Back is simply when you make the call but the person at the Pharmacy declines your connection, while a “Phone Rang Out” is quite simply that. Whether the phone simply continues to ring indefinitely or you were able to leave a Voice Mail, they are all under that heading.

# QA's

Nothing too surprising here. Joel generally handled all the QA’s during January due to his early start no doubt.
