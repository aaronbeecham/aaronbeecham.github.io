# Script Changes for May

There have been drastic changes to the interface for the Hotkey. From a general visual upgrade but also some UX changes to make navigating the Hotkey a little easier. Here is what the current version of the Hotkey looks like:

Support Tab | Loyalty Tab
![]({{ "/images/may2018/change1.png" }}) | ![]({{ "/images/may2018/change2.png" }})

This month also saw the addition of a template for sending off Remote Updates to stores. Rarely done, but now we can appropriatly log it using the Hotkey. 

A bar graph has also been added to the Hotkey which shows the current weekly total for points earned. This is a button on the Main Menu labled "Staff Points", and it looks like this:

![]({{ "/images/may2018/change3.png" }})

There were also a large amount of background changes to the code that wouldn't be all that noticeable. Mostly cleaning up for easier maintenance and an easier way to add and remove sections.

Other than various bug fixes and general improvements, that does it for April changes.
